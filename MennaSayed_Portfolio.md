## 🚀 Featured Projects

## Graduation Project: Mission Control Center 
Under the Supervision of the Egyptian Space Agency
The project aimed to develop an intelligent Mission Control Center (MCC) for monitoring and controlling a simulated CubeSat system. It combined software engineering, embedded systems, real-time data handling, and AI-powered decision-making in one integrated platform. The system allowed users to monitor satellite telemetry data (such as GPS, temperature, gas, and pressure), send remote commands (e.g., activate the onboard camera), and receive AI-based predictions. It included two main artificial intelligence models:
One model predicted the threat level of near-Earth asteroids, using real-time data from NASA's NEO API.
The second model forecasted solar radiation levels using SARIMA time series analysis.
The frontend team developed a dynamic and responsive dashboard using Angular that visualized real-time telemetry and AI model outputs.
 The backend team used Laravel 11 to build and manage the data layer, including database migrations, models, controllers, and API routing to connect the embedded system and frontend interface.
 The embedded systems team built a hardware simulation using STM32 and ESP32-CAM, emulating a CubeSat environment and transmitting real telemetry data to the backend.

### 🌍 Mission Control Center (Graduation Project)
**Role:** Backend Data Handler  
 Focused on backend data preparation and structuring using php Laravel 11, while a teammate handled the API layer.
  ===>Responsibilities included:
Designing and implementing database migrations
Writing controller logic to manage data flow within the system
Preparing clean and validated data for integration with API endpoints
Worked directly with real-time and historical space data from the Egyptian Space Agency and NASA.
Delivered structured data to the backend team for API generation
Tools & Technologies: Laravel 11, MySQL, PHP, VS Code, Xampp , PhpMyAdmin ,  Postman (for team testing)

### 🧠 Asteroid Threat Detection Model  (Graduation Project)
**Role:** AI/ML Developer
Built a complete machine learning model using real-time data from NASA’s asteroid API.
Preprocessed and cleaned dynamic datasets that updated daily.
Trained, evaluated, and optimized the model to detect potentially hazardous near-Earth objects.
Collaborated with frontend and backend teams to integrate model predictions into a live dashboard.

### 📊 Customer Data Management & Analysis  
Part of the **DEPI Diploma**, this project simulates a real telecom customer data environment.  
Developed a comprehensive data analysis and management system to monitor and analyze customer interactions for a leading telecom company. The project involved designing and implementing an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load large-scale data efficiently. Key tools and technologies included Microsoft SQL Server for database management, Microsoft Azure for cloud integration, Python for data processing and analysis, and MLflow for managing machine learning workflows. We sourced the data from Kaggle and performed data cleaning and preparation to make it ready for analysis. I played a critical role in designing the Database Schema, creating all necessary tables, and preparing the data structure. Additionally, I wrote SQL Queries to process and analyze the data, ensuring proper organization and structuring to facilitate insights extraction. The technologies used included Microsoft SQL Server for database management and Python for data analysis..
